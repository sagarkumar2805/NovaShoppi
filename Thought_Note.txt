Project Overview: E-Commerce Website

Project Description:

I developed a full-fledged e-commerce website that allows users to browse and purchase products online.
The project consists of both frontend and backend components for seamless functionality.


1. Frontend:

The frontend is built using React, providing an interactive and dynamic user interface.
I utilized various components, such as forms, buttons, navigation bars, and modals, to create a rich user experience.
React Router is used to implement client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different screens.   



2. Backend:

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing the necessary API endpoints for frontend interaction.
I implemented secure user authentication and authorization, allowing users to sign up, sign in, and manage their profiles.
Token-based authentication was used to ensure secure communication between the frontend and backend.



3. Global State Management:

I employed the Context API along with the useReducer hook to manage global application state.
The Store context provided a centralized location to manage user information, cart items, and other relevant data.



4. User Authentication and Authorization:

Users can sign up and sign in securely.
Authenticated users have access to their profiles, order history, and the ability to update their details.
Admin users have additional privileges, such as managing products, orders, and users.



5. Product Listings and Search:

I fetched product data from the backend API and displayed it on the frontend.
Users can search for products based on keywords and filter products by categories.
The sidebar navigation menu provides an easy way to explore products by category.



6. Shopping Cart and Checkout:

Users can add products to their shopping carts and proceed to checkout.
Shipping address and payment method details are collected during checkout for accurate order processing.



7. Order Management:

Users can view their order history, including order details and status.
Admin users have access to an admin dashboard where they can manage orders and user data.



8. Responsive Design:

The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
The navigation menu collapses into a sidebar on smaller screens to optimize the user experience.



9. Toast Notifications:

I integrated the react-toastify library to display toast notifications for various actions, such as sign in, sign out, and form submissions.


10. Fetching Categories:

Categories are fetched from the backend API and displayed as navigation links in the sidebar.
Clicking on a category link updates the displayed products based on the selected category.


11. Footer and Contact Information:

The footer contains the company's logo, social media links, and copyright information.
A contact section provides users with information on how to reach out to the company.


12. Key Takeaways:

This project showcases my ability to build a fully functional e-commerce website using modern technologies and best practices.
I've demonstrated proficiency in frontend and backend development, user authentication, state management, and API integration.
The project serves as a valuable addition to my portfolio, highlighting my skills in web development and UI/UX design.
